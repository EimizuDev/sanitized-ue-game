# Sanitized Game - Unreal Engine C++

**Status:** archived

**Maintenance:** may be continued in the future.

## Overview

This repository is a **sanitized version** of my Unreal Engine C++ game I was working on in 2025.

It is intentionally trimmed for public view. The full working source is private and available only for technical review on request to certain people.

### Excluded / Private

- A complete inventory system
- Certain assets and code I don't want to share

## What I learned

- Unreal Engine C++ and the editor
- More clean, optimized, modular C++ code
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Network replication for gameplay systems
